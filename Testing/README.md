# My notes template

The dndnotes package is the first version on creating macros and environments for me taking notes in class.

The test.pdf is the result of my playground testing of the dnd as well as the dndnotes packages. The chapters separate subjects like math and coding as well as basic features like paperboxes, commentboxes, etc.
