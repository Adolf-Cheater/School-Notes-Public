# MATH-115-Notes

This is mostly original content with a few figures and examples coming from the professor. 

Moreover, the professor allowed me to share these note to the entire class and apparently it helped a few people.

## Cover page
This is similar to the Dragon books for compilers where calculus is difficult for some people and I wanted to see how my mental image of the cover art would look. It did not disappoint, because Calc 2 is mostly about integration, I added the integration symbol as a blade wielded by Megan from XKCD to "slay" or solve most Calc 2 problems.
