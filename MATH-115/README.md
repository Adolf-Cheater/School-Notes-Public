# MATH-115-Notes

This is mostly original content with a few figures and examples coming from the professor. 

Moreover, the professor wanted me to share these note to the entire class and apparently it helped a few people.

## Cover page
This is similar to the Dragon books for compilers but for calculus. I had an idea on what the cover would look like but wanted visual feedback, so I created it in Photoshop and it did not dissapoint. Because calc 2 is mostly about integration, I added the integration symbol as a blade wielded by Megan from XKCD to "slay" or solve most Calc 2 problems represented by the dragon.
