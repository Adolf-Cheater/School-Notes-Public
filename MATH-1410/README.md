# MATH-1410 Linear Algebra Notes

These are my paper notes that I've LaTeXed trying out my new dndnotes package. I typeset all of this over a weekend. 

In general I liked linear algebra more than calculus. Its more of a conceptual class that I liked compared to the memorization of calculus. Moreover, in later calc classes you learn linear algebra.

I didn't take much examples in class as most of it were done online during the lecture and I don't have access to them.

So why a green dragon? So linear algebra is more conceptual rather than memorization like calculus. Yes there are important concepts in calculus, but there are way more in linear algebra.
You have to be a lot more clever about solving a linear algebra problem compared to a calculus problem. In lectures we talked more on proofs in linear algebra compared to calculus.

Green dragons are the most cunning out of all the true dragons. They like to manipulate creatures and in linear algebra you can and often manipulate objects and models into objects that can be solved using matrix and vector operations.
