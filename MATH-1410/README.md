# MATH-1410 Linear Algebra Notes

These are my paper notes that I've LaTeXed trying out my new dndnotes package. I typeset all of this over a weekend. 

In general I liked linear algebra more than calculus. Its more of a conceptual class that I liked compared to the memorization of calculus. Moreover, in later calc classes you learn linear algebra.

I didn't take much examples in class as most of it were done online during the lecture and I don't have access to them.
