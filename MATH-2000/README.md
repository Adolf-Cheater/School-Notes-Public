# MATH-2000 Mathematical Concepts Notes

These are my paper notes that I've LaTeXed to see how well proofs would work using the dndnotes package.

So why a gold dragon? So proofs in mathematics involves a lot explanation that uses already established theorem, propositions, and rules to derive new rules, theorems, and propositions. Gold dragons at least in lore are paladins of law and order. They have a strong attachment to rules and law.

Moreover, gold dragons tend to become very wise as they age. They freely share their knowledge and experience to anyone who asks. It is not uncommon for gold dragons to have the profession of a scholarly professor, to spread their knowledge at some human center of higher education.
