# Lecture Notes
This is my collection of lecture notes (+ other study things) for courses that I've taken during my undergraduate studies at the University of Alberta.

Most (if not all) of them are typeset to look like a Dungeon and Dragon guide book. **Why?** Well the short story is that I was bored in my Operating Systems Lab and experimented with different LaTeX templates to see which ones I liked. I choose this template: https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template. The rest is history I guess.

This collection is a subset of my School-Notes repository which are my personal notes kept private as it contains active assignments, copyright assets, experimental $\LaTeX$ code, or other forbidden knowledge of the arcane arts |:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:|.    

## (Full story) Why the DnD template?
In the beginning of the Winter 2019 semester I decided to LaTeX all my notes. I had some experience in the previous semesters doing some of my assignments in LaTeX and have found the finished work amazing. So why not LaTeX all my notes, it would look amazing at the end. Moreover, I wanted to try out a new studying technique where I would either write or type my notes in class and typeset them after as review so I can understand the content better. All I needed was a template so I can typeset my notes without worrying about the style and formatting of the notes, what $\LaTeX$ was design for. 

Now this template was chosen by accident. I discovered this template during a lab session for CMPUT-379 and as a joke typeset my MATH-115 notes with it. It turns out, the different boxes used in the template was great at showing important theorems, definitions, notes, etc. The die tables used for DnD was great at describing different variables within an equation or formula.

In addition, I started playing DnD after a 4 month hiatus and the DM finds it hilarious that I decided to typeset my notes to look like a Dungeons and Dragon book. 

##  Note taking 
As stated before 

The only issue was compiling, yes with LaTeX or anything that uses the TeX typesetting engine you have to compile the .tex file with a compiler, and it's painfully slow. Some takes minutes to compile and you need to compile them multiple times in order to get the complete PDF. Thankfully 



## Disclaimer
These notes are not official, and haven't been proofread by the instructor for each course with a couple of exceptions. As such, they are liable to errors or typos. If you find such an error, I'd be greatly appreciate it if you could open a pull request (if you are proficient with LaTeX and have the required template) or open an issue (so that I can fix it). 


## Copyright
Due to the fact that I am using assets from the instructor as well images from Wizard of the Coast. I may have to remove certain elements from this repository. This is easier said than done as GitHub keeps track of all changes including deleted items and its easy for anyone to go back and recover them. It will probably be easier to privatize the entire repository.
