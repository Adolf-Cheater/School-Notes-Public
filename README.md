# Lecture Notes
This is my collection of lecture notes (+ other study things) that I've taken during my undergraduate studies at the University of Alberta.

Some (if not all) of them are typeset to look like a Dungeon and Dragon book. Why? Well the short story is that I was bored in my Operating Systems Lab and experimented with some LaTeX templates. The rest is just history. 



## Disclaimer
These notes are not official, and haven't been proofread by the instructor for each course (with a few exceptions). As such, they are liable to errors or typos. If you find such an error, I will be greatly appreciated if you could open a pull request (if you are proficient in LaTeX and have the required template) or open an issue so that I can fix it. 


## Copyright
Due to the fact that I am using assets from the instructor as well images from Wizard of the Coast. I may have to remove certain elements from this repository. This is easier said than done as github keeps track of all changes including deleted items and its easy for anyone to go back and recover them. It will probably be eaiser to privatize the entire repository.
